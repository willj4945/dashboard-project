## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you’ll need to have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **Streamlit 1.15.0 or higher**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/canada-population-dashboard.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd canada-population-dashboard
    ```
3. **Install the Required Libraries**:
    You can install the necessary libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you don’t have a `requirements.txt` file, manually install the libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas numpy
    ```

4. **Run the Streamlit App**:
    Start the Streamlit server by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

### Usage
- **View Population Data**:  
  - When you launch the app, you’ll see an expandable section titled **"See full data table"**. Click to view the entire dataset.

- **Edit Data**:  
  - Use the form in the app to select the row and column you wish to update. Enter the new value and click **Update**. Your changes will be saved to the CSV file and instantly displayed in the table.

### Project Highlights
1. **Session State Management**:  
   Utilizes `st.session_state` to persist data changes during interactions without reloading the entire app.

2. **CSV Data Handling**:  
   Demonstrates how to load, update, and save changes to a CSV file dynamically using `pandas`.

3. **Expandable UI Elements**:  
   Displays large datasets compactly using `st.expander()` for a clean and interactive UI.

## Future Development
This project is also a testing ground for integrating Streamlit with external APIs. Upcoming features include:

1. **Real-Time Data Fetching**:  
   Implement API calls to fetch up-to-date population data from government or statistics APIs and update the table dynamically.

2. **Data Synchronization**:  
   Sync local changes back to an external database or cloud-based storage using API endpoints.

3. **Data Visualization**:  
   Expand the app to include charts and graphs using `matplotlib` or `plotly` to visualize changes in population trends over time.

4. **User Authentication**:  
   Implement user authentication to secure data modifications and allow different levels of access for viewing or editing data.
